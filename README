Xeer1update
======================

Simple bash script for Xen Server 6.2

- Downloads updates.xml from xenserver and parses it.
- Sorts patches by timestamp and after that by filename in case that there is 2 with the same time stamp.
- Downloads and installs all missing patches
- If the zip files are already downloaded, it will not download them again.
